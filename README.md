# stock-analysis
## VBA  Challenge Project
### This challenge was to use a refactored VBA script, which will loop through all the data once and collect all the needed information to analyze the stocks to determine their performance. These refactored scripts are expected to run faster than the original code used in the module.
#### Overview of the Project
    * Download of the "Challenge_starter_code.vbs" file and renamed it "VBA_Challenge.vbs"
    * Creation of "Resources" folder to hold the run time pop-up messages screenshots after running refactored analyses for 2017 and 2018.
    * Renaming for "green_stocks.xlsm" used for this module as "VBA_Challenge.xlsm".
    * Adding the "VBA_Challenge.vbs" script to Microsoft  Visual Basic Editor.
    * The refactored script was edited and changed by numbered comments in the starter code file

##### Results
    *The result of both the refactored and original code for the analysis of the stocks is the same, but the execution rate is different as the refactored code was faster.

    * Nearly all stocks were in the green zone in 2017; and performing well. DQ (199.4%) and  SPWR(184.5%)stocks were outstanding.TERP stocks were not performing well(-7.2%).
   
   * The contrast is true in 2018 when almost all the stocks were in the Red Zone because they were not performing well, including the high-performing stocks of 2017 like DQ and SPWR. Only two stocks, ENPH and RUN, were performing well with 81.9% and 84% rates of returns.
   
   *  Refactored VBA script was much faster than the original script used in the module; simultaneously, it took the original code 0.98s to execute the 2017 stocks analysis and the refactored script 0.17s to analyze the same data.
   
   *  It took the original Script 1.066s to analyze the stocks data of 2018; the refactored script took 0.144s to execute the 2018 stocks analysis

   ###### Summary
   ###### Advantanges of Refactoring Code
        *Refactoring code has a lot of advantages over the original code; its execution is faster. In addition, Refactoring makes the code easier to understand as it is a known fact that developers read code much more often than they write. Therefore, it is in the stakeholder's best interest to keep the code as understandable as possible, increasing its maintainability. Also, Refactoring is a way of sharing knowledge because by refactoring a code, you gain a more profound understanding of what it does even though you did not write it initially.
   ###### Disadvantage of Refacoring Code
         *The only disadvantage I could see is that cracking all the code is time-consuming, but it is worth it.
  ###### Advantage of the Original Code
       *it is simpler and easier to use
  ###### Disadvantage of the Original Code
       *its execution is slow and has a lot of redundant and repetitive code
