# stock-analysis.
## VBA  Challenge Project
### This challenge was to used  refactor VBA script which will loop through all the data one time and collect all the needed information to analyse how the stocks are performing and this refactor script is expected to run faster than the one used in the module.
#### Overview of the Project
   * Download of the Challenge_starter_code.vbs file and renamed it VBA_Challeng.vbs
   * Creation of "Resources" folder to hold the run time pop up messages that are screenshot after runing refactored analysyes for 2017 and 2018.
   * Renaming for "green_stocks.xlsm" used for this module as "VBA_Challenge.xlsm".
   * Adding the "VBA_Challenge.vbs script to Microsoft  Visual Basic Editor.
   * The refactored script was editted and changed by numbered comments in starter code file
##### Results
   *The result of both refactored and original code for the stocks analysis  basically the same  but the rate of execution is different as the refactored code was faster
   * Almost the all stocks were in green zone in 2017,they were performing well, DQ(199.4%) and  SPWR(184.5%)stocks were outstanding.TERP stocks were not performing          well(-7.2%).
   *The contrasts is true in 2018, when almost all the stocks were in the Red Zone buecause they are not preforming well including the high performing stocks of 2017    like DQ and SPWR stocks. Only two stocks ENPH and RUN were perfoming well 81.9% and 84% rate of returns.
   *Refactored VBA script was very much faster than the original script used in module,while it took the original code 1.24s to execucte 2017 stocks analysis, it took the refactored script 0.21s.
   While it took the original Script 1.53s to analyse the stoxks of 2018, the refractored script took 0.33s to execute the 2018 stocks analysis

   ###### Summary
   ###### Advantanges of Refactoring Code
        *Refactoring code has a lot advantages over the original code, its execution is faster, Refactoring makes the caode easier to understand as it is a known fact  that developer read code much more often than they write, it is the best interest of stakeholder to keep code as understanble as possible which greatly increase it maitainablilty.Also refactoring is way of sharing knowledge because refactoring a code you gain a deeper knowledge what it does even thou you did not write it originally.
   ###### Disadvantage of Refacoring Code
        *The only disadvantage i could see is that it is time cousuming cracking all the code but it worths it
  ###### Advantage of the Original Code
        *it is simpler and easier 
  ###### Disadvantage of the Original Code
        *its execution is very slow and has a lot redundant and repeatitive code
